## 📊 Overview  
This project analyzes real-world web analytics data from **The Recording Academy**, the organization behind the **Grammy Awards**.  
The goal was to evaluate the impact of splitting their original website into two distinct domains:  
**grammy.com** (for fans and event content) and **recordingacademy.com** (for members and industry professionals).  

Using **Python** and **data visualization** tools, the analysis uncovers trends in traffic, engagement, and audience behavior to deliver **data-driven recommendations** for digital strategy.

## 🧠 Key Objectives  
✅ Assess how the website split affected user engagement and traffic  
✅ Identify behavioral differences between audiences

## 🔍 Key Findings  

### 1️⃣ Engagement Trends  
- During award season, traffic spikes dramatically, with over **40× higher** visits than on a regular day.  
- After splitting the websites, **pages per session nearly doubled** (from ~1 to ~2–3), showing improved content engagement.  

### 2️⃣ Bounce Rate & Session Duration  
- **RecordingAcademy.com** achieved the **lowest bounce rate (~33%)** and **longest session duration (~128 seconds)**.  
- **Grammy.com** retained strong event-based visitors but shorter sessions, reflecting its focus on seasonal content.  

### 3️⃣ Demographics  
- Both sites have similar audience distributions.  
- Younger (18–24) and older (55+) groups lean toward **Grammy.com**, while middle-aged visitors favor **RecordingAcademy.com**.

## 🧾 Recommendation  
Keeping **grammy.com** and **recordingacademy.com** separate is the best strategy.  
Post-split data shows higher engagement and clearer audience segmentation.  
The dual-site structure enables **focused content delivery**, with *Grammy.com* for fans and *RecordingAcademy.com* for professionals, strengthening overall brand reach and engagement.
